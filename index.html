            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Alok Singh. My journey into the world of data began with the vast datasets of the cosmos in Astrophysics and has since focused sharply on the practical power of AI and Machine Learning. I hold an MSc with Distinction in Data Science from the University of Hertfordshire, where I specialized in Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Applied Data Science, building upon a BSc in Astrophysics rich in computational physics and programming (Python, MATLAB).
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Exeter's Clinical and Biomedical Sciences department, I am immersed in analyzing data to understand the aetiology of symptoms reported during the menopause transition, applying my analytical skills to contribute to vital biomedical research. This role complements my prior professional experience where I've developed cutting-edge AI/ML solutions. At GV Black Dentech, I engineered models using EfficientNet and CNNs for high-level feature extraction from X-ray images, achieving remarkable precision. As a Data Science Intern with Climate Connect Digital, I developed time series and gradient boosting models that drastically improved day-ahead energy market predictions, reducing MAPE from nearly 60% to just over 4%. My research background also includes developing physics-based algorithms to analyze astronomical data, such as detecting binary star systems from Gaia telescope data.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive on leveraging tools like Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache Spark to transform complex data into meaningful insights and robust applications. I'm driven by a curiosity to understand complex systems and a passion for building solutions that make a tangible impact across diverse fields – from astrophysics and energy markets to current challenges in biomedical science.
